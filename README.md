### BitTorrent extension for peers to send ethereum address to maybe get rewards


This bitTorrent extention is made for peers to reward each other when they send you some data.
When you get data from a peer you also get the peer's ethereum address and the amount of data transfered. Now you can send them a reward if you wish to!

Works in the browser with [browserify](http://browserify.org/)!


##This package is not stable yet!
